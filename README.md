Unmaintained

I rediscovered  this codebase on my old server and thought I'd update the repo on GitHub. This application was created back when [EMDR](https://github.com/blitzmann/emdr-py) was a thing. That was shut down in 2017. However, even before this happened my old server went offline during a move and never came back up, and at the time I had lost motivation to get it reconfigured (it was a huge PITA due to EMDR / Redis reliance)

As of now, this project is dead. I have updated it so that it will at least run on a web server running PHP. The main feature missing is accurate pricing for the gas types. Since that's the whole point of the applciation, unless that is fixed, it's nothing more than a proof of concept.

This repo is here for archival purposes. Maybe in the future I'll try to rewrite it as a strictly client side application and have GitHub pages host it.
