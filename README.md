Unmaintained
===
I rediscovered  this codebase on my old server and thought I'd update the repo on GitHub. This application was created back when [EMDR](https://github.com/blitzmann/emdr-py) was a thing. That was shut down in 2017. However, even before this happened my old server went offline during a move and never came back up, and at the time I had lost motivation to get it reconfigured (it was a huge PITA due to EMDR / Redis reliance)

As of now, this project is unmaintained and not actively hosted anywhere. I have taken the time to update some bits of the code that that it would be easy enough to run on any webserver with PHP. This include updating the price information to use evemarketer as the source.

For now, this repo is here for archival purposes. Maybe in the future I'll try to rewrite it as a strictly client side application and have GitHub pages host it. :)
